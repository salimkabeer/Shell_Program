When you change your password with passwd command, your new password is stored in the file /etc/shadow.

Additional permissions are given to programs via a mechanism known as the Set User ID (SUID)and Set Group ID (SGID)bits.
When you execute a program that has the SUID bit enabled, you inherit the permissions of that  program's  owner.  
Programs  that  do  not  have  the  SUID  bit  set  are  run  with  the permissions of the user who started the program.
This is the case with SGID as well. Normally, programs execute with your group permissions, but  instead  your  group  
will  be  changed  just  for  this  program  to  the  group  owner  of  the program.The SUID and SGID bits will appear 
as the letter "s" if the permission is available. The SUID "s" bit will be located in the permission bits where the 
owners execute permission normally resides. For example, the command -

salim@salim-VirtualBox ~ $ ls -l /usr/bin/passwd 
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 59640 Jan 25  2018 /usr/bin/passwd

# To set the SUID and SGID bits for any directory :-
$ chmod ug+s dirname
$ ls -l
drwsr-sr-x 2 root root  4096 Jun 19 06:45 dirname
